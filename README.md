<b>ExoCAT : Exoplanet Coronagraphy and Cross-correlation Analysis Tools</b> 

ExoCAT presents codes and tools developed as part of GTO ExoMIRI (GTO 1277 and 1194 : Boccaletti et al. 2024, Mâlin et al. 2024, Mâlin et al. 2025) and used in the context of MIRI coronagraphy data analysis (e.g., GO 3662,  Lagrange et al. 2025). 

It also contains useful tools for MIRI-MRS data analysis, especially cross-correlation and molecular mapping analysis tools (used to analyse data from programs : ERS 1386, GO 3647, GO 4829).

- Notebooks are available to show exemple of analysis with MIRI coronagraphy stellar subtraction and photometry in the case for TWA 7 b.
- More tools and notebooks can be available upon request.

ExoCAT relies on many other packages and software : numpy, astropy, scipy, matplotlib, photutils, webbpsf, jwst pipeline.
