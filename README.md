<b>ExoCAT</b>

ExoCAT presents codes and tools developed as part of GTO ExoMIRI (GTO 1277 and 1194 : Boccaletti et al. 2024, Mâlin et al. 2024, Mâlin et al. 2025) and used in the context of MIRI coronagraphy data analysis (e.g., GO 3662,  Lagrange et al. 2025).

- Notebooks are available to show exemple for stellar subtraction, and photometry analysis.
- More tools and notebooks can be available upon request.

Cross-correlation and molecular mapping analysis tools coming soon for MIRI-MRS data (used to analyse data from programs : ERS 1386, GO 3647, GO 4829).

ExoCAT relies on many other packages and software : numpy, astropy, scipy, matplotlib, photutils, webbpsf, jwst pipeline.
